Always praying and coding.
<br><br>
This is what I think about coding:
<br><br>
1. Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do. ―<b> Donald Ervin Knuth </b> <br>
2. No matter which field of work you want to go in, it is of great importance to learn at least one programming language. ― <b>Ram Ray</b><br>
3. If, at first, you do not succeed, call it version 1.0. ― <b>Khayri R.R. Woulfe</b><br>
4. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. — <b>Robert C. Martin</b><br>
5. Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes. –<b> Oscar Wilde</b> <br><br>
Coding has the future. To stand in the future, I need to learn coding. Coding can generate a whole new world of technologies. Coding can be a gateway of opportunities (which are provided by God. For this reason I will humble myself before him and give Him thanks first for it as it is written: "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up." (James 4:10))<br>
<br>
<b>I will get opportunities and will grab them with the help of God. I will succeed in the future.</b>
