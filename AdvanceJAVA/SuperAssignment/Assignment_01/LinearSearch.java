/* 
Take as sc N, the size of an array. Take N more inputs and store that in an array. Take another numberâ€™s sc as M. Write a function which returns the index on which M is found in an array, in case M is not found -1 is returned. Print the value returned.

It reads a number N.
2.Take Another N numbers as an sc and store them in an Array.
Take another number M as an sc.
If M is found in the Array the index of M is returned else -1 is returned and print the value returned.
Input Format
Constraints
N cannot be Negative. Range of Numbers can be between -1000000000 to 1000000000. M can be between -1000000000 to 1000000000.
